## About

Another game engine with vulkan renderer (the goal is to support multiple APIs). This project is my sandbox for learning and experimenting with computer graphics/game engines related topics. The engine itself is separated into modules that can be used separately (even though some of them depends on another ones). Final attempt, I promise!
